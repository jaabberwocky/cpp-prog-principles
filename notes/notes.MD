Notes written while reading Bjarne Stroustrup's Programming and Principles in C++.

### Ch5 - Errors

Programs should be:
1. Produce desired results for all legal inputs
2. Should give reasonable error message for all illegal inputs
3. Need not worry about misbehaving hardware
4. Need not worry about misbehaving system software
5. Is allowed to terminate after finding an error

3 approaches to producing acceptable software:
1. Organise software to minimise errors
2. Eliminate most of the errors we made through debugging and testing
3. Make sure the remaining errors are not serious
